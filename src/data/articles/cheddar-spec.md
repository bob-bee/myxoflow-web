# Cheddar: Complete Business/Brand Blueprint

***

## Executive Summary

**Cheddar** is a members-only dating app that aligns platform quality, user verification, and transparency with a radical departure from algorithm-driven design. It uses dynamic pricing to maintain a balanced, serious pool of verified singles. The approach is governed by privacy-first principles, compliance discipline, and a results-focused brand voice.

***

## Core Concept

- **Cheddar is not algorithmic:** No black-box matching, no engagement-optimization. Matches are the result of *user action* in a transparent pool.
- **Dynamic capacity management:** The platform continuously tracks gender and engagement balance. Membership fees automatically adjust based on current demand and composition to throttle oversupply on either side (without ever exposing ratios or gendered pricing publicly).
- **Verification-first:** Every member undergoes a two-step process: government-issued photo ID check and in-app camera-only liveness detection (head turn, blink, no photo uploads). Re-verification reoccurs every 3–6 months to keep the platform bot- and scammer-free.
- **No data-selling:** Absolutely no collection or commercialization of user data beyond what is needed for the verification and platform operation.
- **Churn by design:** Success means members meet partners and leave the app quickly. This is managed by referral-driven growth and reactivation incentives.

## Membership & Monetization

- **Fee Structure:**  
  - Fees are variable: dynamically adjusted per city and current demand. There is no public mention of gender pricing, even though internally, capacity and prices are privately managed to maintain pool balance.
  - Standard pricing example:  
    - Men: Minimum €100 for 30 days (manual renew)
    - Women: Complimentary up to 90 days (auto-renew), then slots freed for waitlist
  - Membership is non-recurring by default for men; auto-renew for women
- **Capacity Management:**
  - Pool capacities (e.g., 1,000 men/5,000 women) and male:female ratios are internal tools **never revealed** externally.
  - When a side goes over capacity, lowest-engagement members are auto-paused with pro-rated refund.
  - When demand surges, monthly fee increases in increments (e.g., +€25), shown as "current membership rate" only.
  - Waitlist activates upon reaching capacity; members are admitted in priority order.
- **Referral System:**
  - Successful exits (finding a match) prompt members to refer friends via unique codes/links.
  - Referral credits (e.g., €50) are granted for each active referral and can be used for re-entry or discounts if returning.
  - Returning users within 90 days can rejoin at their last paid rate; after 90 days, they pay the current rate.

## Discoverability & User Experience

- **Discovery Tools Only:**  
  Filters (age, location, preferences), proximity sorting, mutual interest indication, keyword search, and recent activity—all transparent and user-driven.
- **No algorithmic feeds or ranking:**  
  Every member can browse the full pool that matches their filter—no hidden curation, boosting, or engagement maximization.
- **Messaging:**  
  Direct chat (post-verification), without gamified "swiping" or algorithmic match queues.

***

## Brand Voice & Comms

- **Direct. Confident. Privacy-First.**  
  Key brand descriptors: verified, exclusive, results-oriented, and simple.
- **Messaging examples:**  
  - “Verified members. Real connections. No hidden algorithms.”
  - “Membership availability based on platform health.”
  - “We verify every member—no bots, no scammers, no catfishing.”
  - “The dating app that wants you to leave.”
- **Never say:**  
  - “For men/women only” or “ladies join free”
  - Anything referencing gender-based pricing, ratios, or any discriminatory language.

***

## Legal & Compliance Protocol

- **Privacy by design:**  
  Explicit opt-in consent for any ID/biometric verification.  
  Verification data is encrypted, stored no longer than necessary (typically 30 days), and deleted according to privacy policy.
- **GDPR/BIPA compliance:**  
  Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) conducted before launch, plus regular legal review.
  Third-party vendors for verification (e.g., Stripe Identity, Onfido) must be GDPR-compliant and sign formal DPAs.
- **User Rights:**  
  Full access, correction, and erasure options through account settings.
  72-hour breach notification policy included in incident response.
- **Public messaging on compliance:**  
  "Cheddar applies the highest standards of GDPR-compliant privacy protection and never sells your data.”

***

## App Store and Payment Policy

- **Zero gendered or discriminatory copy:**  
  All app descriptions, ad campaigns, and support templates reviewed to ensure strict guideline compliance.
- **Dynamic pricing described as “membership fee”** (no mention of variable pricing tied to gender/age).
- **In-app purchases:**  
  Uses official payment APIs (Apple In-App Purchase, Google Play Billing). Option for external payment in regions that permit it (e.g., Netherlands).
- **Refunds, cancellation, and chargeback:**  
  Easy cancellation from the app. Voluntary or automated pause yields pro-rated refund.

***

## Operational Safeguards

- **No public ratios, ever:**  
  All public language refers to “dynamic capacity” or “demand-based pricing” without numbers or gender references.
- **Bidding / dynamic pricing:**  
  Internally, price moves up/down in increments depending on how full the pool is. Externally, users see only the current price.
- **Backups:**  
  Multiple payment processor relationships are prepared in case of rejection. Web-based version is available as fallback if app store approval is revoked.
- **Internal communications:**  
  Staff are trained never to disclose gender-based management or ratio logic to users or in support materials.

***

## User Churn & Growth Strategy

- **Referral growth engine:**  
  Exit is celebrated—users leaving after finding a match are prompted to refer friends (who skip the waitlist), and given small monetary or time-based credits for return visits.
- **Reactivation incentives:**  
  Users returning after a break get a discount or priority reinstatement, especially if they made successful referrals.
- **Waitlist marketing:**  
  Demand for membership is driven through exclusivity and controlled referrals, especially city-by-city launches. Growth is staged and localized.

***

## Launch & GTM

- **Phased city-based launch:**  
  Start with invite-only cohort in a major city (e.g., Amsterdam, Berlin, London).  
  Control both slots and referral-driven growth, gradually expanding to new locations.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Metrics tracked: verification success, fake profile rate, pool churn, match/exit rate.
- **Storytelling:**  
  Early testimonials and PR focused on "finding love efficiently" and “verified members = safer experience.”
- **Crisis comms:**  
  Prewritten statements for accusations of discrimination:  
  “Our fees and availability reflect real-time demand, not protected attributes. No member is favored or excluded by category; all are fully verified.”

***

## What Cheddar Does **Not** Do

- No algorithmic matchmaking or secret compatibility scoring
- No sale, sharing, or secondary use of user data
- No gender-targeted offers or pricing
- No discriminatory, inflammatory, or exclusionary language in product or marketing
- No auto-renewal for men’s memberships (strictly manual renewal)
- No gallery/uploads for photos—always in-app, live capture only

***

## Growth & Exit Strategy

- **Referral-driven, city-by-city rollout** to maintain quality and avoid scaling problems.
- **Exit via acquisition:**  
  Once network effects and revenue are proven, Cheddar targets acquisition by a major dating portfolio (Match Group, Bumble, etc.) at a typical 8–12x revenue multiple.
